# Why Use Vorteil?
It's Secure
 There is no user interface in the Vorteil OS, and thus the largest typical attack vector for hackers doesn't exist! Using the microservices architecture approach, you can also spin up and down VMs on demand, meaning there's no possible session hijacking or replaying either.

## It's Fast
Vorteil VMs are amazingly fast, they can boot up in ~31ms! There's no user space, so the OS doesn't have to context switch, leaving all resources dedicated to running your applications.

## It's Optimised
The Vorteil OS is tiny, less than 1MB. This means that all of your compute infrastructure can be used to run your apps and services, there's no huge overhead just to keep a server running.

## Minimal Administration
 Patching your servers is a thing of the past. With Vorteil, the only components of the OS are the drivers to provide CPU, disk, memory, and network. If ever you do need to upgrade the OS, just download the new version, and get VMS to recompile your apps and replace the fleet, the process can take as little as 100ms to completely replace a running virtual machine!
