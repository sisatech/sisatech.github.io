!> We recommend you install VirtualBox before installing vcli.

Download the osx-amd64 binary from the latest [github release](https://github.com/sisatech/vcli/releases).

Rename the file to vcli, chmod it to make it executable, and move it somewhere on the PATH.

Verify the installion worked by running a vcli command.
```bash
vcli version
```
