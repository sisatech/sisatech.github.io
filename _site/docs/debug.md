# Debugging
VCLI has several built-in flags to assist users with the process of debugging their applications.

>Debug -d

The Vorteil Application will build using the debug version of the kernel, creating a GDB server within the Vorteil app. The resulting Virtual Machine will output helpful debug information to the screen.

>Echo -e

Reroutes the Virtual Machine's serial console to stdout, printing output to the terminal.

>Persist --persist

Saves the built disk image to the specified filepath, preventing it from being cleaned up when the process is complete.

For example, to run an app with debugging, echo, and persist flags:

			vcli run MyApplication -d -e --persist=disks/myapplication.vmdk
This will build and run the application using the debug kernel, print all serial output to the terminal, and save a persistent copy of the resulting disk image file to the specified filepath.

In addition to these tools, it is also possible to mount the second partition of your disk images, to check the contents or integrity of the disk filesystem. One example of this is using VMware is:

		vmware-mount diskPath 2 mountPoint
The second partition of disk image files generated by VCLI contains the filesystem. This allows users to mount the filesystem independently of the remaining partitions.
